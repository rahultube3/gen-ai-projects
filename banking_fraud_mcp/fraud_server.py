- Pattern recognition algorithms ✅
- Compliance reporting ✅

### Recent Updates
- Enhanced location-based risk scoring
- Improved amount threshold detection
- Updated customer risk profiles
- Optimized database performance

### Alert Thresholds
- **High Risk**: Fraud score > 0.5
- **Critical Amount**: Transactions > $3000
- **Suspicious Locations**: Non-HomeCity transactions
- **Time-based**: Unusual hour transactions

## High-Risk Indicators

### Transaction Amounts
- **Critical Threshold**: $3,000+
- **Penalty Score**: +0.3 to fraud score
- **Rationale**: Large amounts often indicate fraudulent activity

### Geographic Risk Factors
- **Safe Locations**: HomeCity (no penalty)
- **Risky Locations**: Las Vegas, New York, Unknown
- **Penalty Score**: +0.2 to fraud score
- **Pattern**: 78% of fraud occurs outside home city

### Customer Risk Profiles
- **Low Risk** (0.0 - 0.2): Established customers, good history
- **Medium Risk** (0.2 - 0.5): Some suspicious activity
- **High Risk** (0.5 - 1.0): Multiple red flags, requires monitoring

### Temporal Patterns
- **Peak Fraud Hours**: 2-4 AM, 10-12 PM
- **Weekend Risk**: 23% higher fraud rates
- **Holiday Patterns**: Increased activity during holidays

### Behavioral Indicators
- Sudden large transactions
- Multiple transactions in short time
- Transactions in unfamiliar locations
- Amounts just below reporting thresholds

## Recommended Actions
- Monitor transactions > $2,500
- Flag all non-HomeCity transactions > $1,000
- Review customers with risk score > 0.3
- Implement additional verification for high-risk times

### txn002 - LOW RISK EXAMPLE  
- **Customer**: Bob (cust456)
- **Amount**: $150
- **Location**: HomeCity
- **Expected Score**: 0.05 (Low Risk)
- **Risk Factors**: None (safe transaction)

### txn003 - VERY HIGH RISK EXAMPLE
- **Customer**: Carol (cust789) 
- **Amount**: $5,000
- **Location**: Las Vegas
- **Expected Score**: 1.3 (Very High Risk)

### txn004 - LOW RISK EXAMPLE
- **Customer**: Alice (cust123)
- **Amount**: $25

## Transaction Analysis Framework

### 1. Risk Assessment Methodology
- Evaluate fraud score components (customer risk + amount + location)
- Assess transaction patterns and anomalies
- Consider temporal and behavioral factors
- Review historical customer data

### 2. Key Risk Indicators
- **Amount Risk**: Transactions > $3,000 (+0.3 score)
- **Location Risk**: Non-HomeCity transactions (+0.2 score)  
- **Customer Risk**: Base risk profile (0.0 - 1.0)
- **Temporal Risk**: Unusual timing patterns
- **Behavioral Risk**: Deviation from normal patterns

### 3. Analysis Questions
- Is this transaction consistent with customer history?
- Are there multiple risk factors present?
- What is the likelihood of fraud based on patterns?
- What additional verification might be needed?

### 4. Recommendation Framework
- **Low Risk (≤0.5)**: Process normally, minimal monitoring
- **High Risk (>0.5)**: Enhanced verification, manual review
- **Critical Risk (>1.0)**: Hold transaction, immediate investigation

## Security Advisory Framework

### Current Risk Level: {risk_level.upper()}

### 1. Fraud Prevention Best Practices
- Implement multi-factor authentication for high-value transactions
- Monitor for unusual transaction patterns and locations
- Maintain updated customer risk profiles
- Use real-time transaction screening

### 2. Detection Strategies
- **Amount-based screening**: Flag transactions above thresholds
- **Geographic analysis**: Monitor location-based risks  
- **Temporal patterns**: Identify unusual timing
- **Customer behavior**: Track deviations from normal patterns

### 3. Response Protocols
- **Immediate**: Hold suspicious transactions pending review
- **Short-term**: Contact customer for verification
- **Medium-term**: Update risk profiles based on findings
- **Long-term**: Adjust detection algorithms and thresholds

### 4. Compliance Considerations
- Document all fraud detection decisions
- Maintain audit trails for regulatory review
- Report suspicious activities as required
- Ensure customer privacy protection

### 5. Technology Recommendations  
- Real-time fraud scoring systems
- Machine learning pattern recognition
- Geographic risk databases
- Customer behavior analytics

### 6. Staff Training Areas
- Fraud indicator recognition
- Customer verification procedures
- Escalation protocols
- Regulatory compliance requirements
