## Usage Examples

```bash
# Build the ML-enhanced Docker image
./docker-manage.sh build

# Start the fraud detection system
./docker-manage.sh start

# Check ML models status
./docker-manage.sh ml-status

# Run comprehensive ML tests
./docker-manage.sh test-ml

# Train/retrain ML models
./docker-manage.sh ml-train

# Start with monitoring dashboard
./docker-manage.sh start-monitoring

# View container status and health
./docker-manage.sh status

# Access container shell for debugging
./docker-manage.sh shell
```

## Production Deployment

1. **Configuration**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and customize
2. **Build**: Run `./docker-manage.sh build` to create ML-enabled image
3. **Deploy**: Use `./docker-manage.sh start` for basic deployment
4. **Monitor**: Use `./docker-manage.sh start-monitoring` for full observability
5. **Validate**: Run `./docker-manage.sh ml-status` to verify ML components

## Resource Requirements

- **Memory**: 1GB limit (512MB reserved) for ML model operations
- **CPU**: 1.0 core limit (0.5 reserved) for XGBoost processing
- **Storage**: Volumes for persistent model storage and logging
- **Network**: Custom bridge network for service communication

## Performance Optimizations

- **OpenMP**: Multi-threading support for XGBoost acceleration
- **Model Caching**: Pre-trained models loaded at startup
- **Resource Limits**: Prevents resource exhaustion in production
- **Health Checks**: Fast startup detection and failure recovery
- **Volume Persistence**: Avoids model retraining on container restart

The Docker environment is now fully optimized for XGBoost ML fraud detection with comprehensive monitoring, management, and operational capabilities.
